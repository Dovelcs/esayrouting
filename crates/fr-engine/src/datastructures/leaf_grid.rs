//! Secondary spatial index over the leaves of a [`MinAreaTree`](super::MinAreaTree) (performance
//! only): a hierarchy of uniform grids over the x/y ranges of the leaf bounding shapes.
//!
//! It answers "which leaves may intersect this query" with a superset of candidates; the caller
//! applies the same exact `RegularTileShape.intersects` test the tree traversal applies to the
//! leaves. For every combination of `IntBox` / `IntOctagon` that test fails when
//! `leaf.lx > q.rx || q.lx > leaf.rx` (same for y), so for a query with a proper x/y range
//! (`lx <= rx`, `ly <= ry`) every leaf with a proper range that passes the test is found through
//! the cells of the query's x/y range. Leaves with an improper range are kept in a list that is
//! tested for every query; queries with an improper range are not supported (callers use the tree
//! traversal).
//!
//! Level `k` has cells of side `2^(shift + k)`; a leaf is stored in the finest level where it
//! spans at most `SPAN + 1` cells per axis, and in each of those cells. It is reported only in
//! the cell of the reference point `(max(leaf.lx, q.lx), max(leaf.ly, q.ly))`, so no
//! deduplication is needed. [`LayeredGrid`] keeps one such grid per layer (leaf mask bit).
//!
//! The set of leaves found equals the set the Java traversal finds: the bounding shape of an
//! inner node contains the bounding shapes of its children (in terms of the box / octagon
//! parameters, which is what the intersection test compares), so every leaf that intersects the
//! query is reached by the traversal. The randomized test
//! `indexed_and_masked_queries_match_the_traversal` and the `FASTROUTE_VERIFY_CACHES=1` mode check
//! this.
//!
//! Storage is flat (cell heads + an entry slab with free list), so cloning is a few `memcpy`s.
