# fastroute for KiCad

A KiCad PCB editor plugin that autoroutes the board with `fastroute` — no Java
needed. It uses KiCad's built-in Specctra exchange (export DSN, route, import
SES) and adds a few steps that make the result DRC-clean in KiCad.

## Install

1. Build the package: `integrations/kicad/package.sh` (add `--pgo` for a
   ~15 % faster binary). This writes `dist/fastroute-kicad-<version>.zip` with
   the `fastroute` binary for the current platform bundled.
2. In KiCad: **Plugin and Content Manager → Install from File…** and pick the zip.
3. The action appears under **Tools → External Plugins → fastroute autorouter**
   (and as a toolbar button).

The plugin finds `fastroute` in this order: `$FASTROUTE_BIN`, the bundled
`plugins/bin/<platform>/`, `PATH`.

## Options

| Option | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Mode | Fast | *Fast*: parallel optimizer. *Exact*: bit-identical to Freerouting's deterministic mode (single-threaded optimizer). *Quick*: autorouter only. |
| Max. passes | 0 | Autorouter pass limit (0 = until done/stagnant). |
| Remove existing tracks | off | Deletes unlocked tracks/vias first; locked ones are kept. |
| Keep all existing tracks unchanged | off | Routes only the open connections. Otherwise unlocked existing tracks are part of the routing: the router may move, shorten or reroute them while it optimizes (locked ones are always kept). Unlocked tracks are locked for the run and unlocked again afterwards. CLI: `--keep-existing`. |
| Route zone nets with tracks | on | KiCad exports copper zones as Specctra *planes* covering the zone outline, so the router assumes every pad of the zone's net is connected; the refilled zone may cut pads off. Pours are removed and their nets routed with tracks. A power-type layer with a plane covering most of the board stays a plane layer (pads connect through vias); other power-type layers are routed like signal layers. |
| Keep tracks away from copper texts | on | KiCad's export omits copper texts; each glyph is added as a keepout. |
| Respect minimum track width | on | Uses *Board Setup → Constraints → Minimum track width*: neck-down stops there, and connections that do not fit are retried with traces of that width. The board's copper-to-edge clearance is passed on as well. |
| Keep zone stitching vias | on | Vias that no track touches (GND stitching, thermal vias) are locked for the run and kept, also with *Remove existing tracks*. Freerouting treats a lone via as a dangling tail and removes it after every pass. CLI: `--no-keep-stitching` turns it off. |
| Refill zones | on | Refills all zones after importing the result. |
| Show the routing live in the web browser | off | Opens a local page (`http://127.0.0.1:7878`, the next free port if taken) showing the board as it is routed: traces appearing and ripped up, the remaining airlines, progress of each pass, unrouted connections per pass, clearance violations and the log. *Stop* on the page stops like the dialog's Stop button but keeps the best result. Routing results are the same with or without it. CLI: `--live`. |

## Headless use

`plugins/route_cli.py` routes a `.kicad_pcb` file without the GUI. Run it with
KiCad's Python (it needs the `pcbnew` module):

```sh
PY=/Applications/KiCad/KiCad.app/Contents/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/python3
$PY integrations/kicad/plugins/route_cli.py board.kicad_pcb -o routed.kicad_pcb --clear
# with a time limit (keeps the best result) and extra fastroute settings after "--"
$PY integrations/kicad/plugins/route_cli.py board.kicad_pcb -o routed.kicad_pcb --max-time 3000 \
    -- --router.autorouter.ignore_net_classes=GUC
```

From Python, `core.Router(board, extra_args=..., max_time=seconds)` does the same.
fastroute rewrites its session file with the best board so far after every
improvement; if the process ends abnormally (killed, crashed) the router still
imports that file and sets `result.partial`.

Length matching: if the board's `.kicad_dru` has `skew` or `length (min …)` rules for net
classes or net names, the plugin passes them to fastroute, which adds meanders after routing
(see docs/IMPROVEMENTS.md). Example:

```
(rule "SDRAM data"
  (condition "A.NetName == '/SD_D*' || A.NetName == '/SD_NBL*'")
  (constraint skew (max 0.5mm)))
```

Intra-pair skew: a skew rule with `(within_diff_pairs)` matches the two nets of every pair:

```
(rule "USB skew"
  (condition "A.inDiffPair('/USB_D')")
  (constraint skew (max 0.2mm) (within_diff_pairs)))
```

Controlled impedance: `impedance_cli.py` computes trace widths for target
impedances from the board's stackup and, with `--write`, adds per-layer
`track_width` rules to the `.kicad_dru`. The plugin then routes those classes
with the per-layer widths and without neck-down:

```
$PY integrations/kicad/plugins/impedance_cli.py board.kicad_pcb --class RF=50 --class USB=90d --write
```

A target ending in `d` is differential (`--gap` sets the pair gap, default
equal to the width). Solder mask is not included; check the widths against
your fabricator's stackup.

Differential pairs: every `.kicad_dru` rule with a `diff_pair_gap` constraint makes the
matching nets pairs (KiCad naming: `NAME+`/`NAME-` or `NAMEP`/`NAMEN`), routed first with
the rule's gap (`opt`, else `min`; per layer if the rule has a `layer`). After routing the
shorter net of each pair gets meanders until the two lengths differ by at most 0.1 mm (set
another tolerance with a `skew` rule on the pair's nets, or `--pair-skew=MM` after `--` in
`route_cli.py`; 0 turns it off). The impedance rules
of `impedance_cli.py` for `90d`-style targets contain such constraints. By hand:

```
(rule "USB"
  (condition "A.inDiffPair('/USB_D')")
  (constraint diff_pair_gap (opt 0.2mm)))
```

Zones: by default a zone on a *power*-type layer covering at least half of the
board stays a plane (pads connect with vias, no tracks on that layer); other
zones are removed for routing and their nets are routed with tracks, then the
zones are refilled. `--zones-as-planes` (`route_zone_nets=False`) keeps every
zone as a plane instead, like the plain Freerouting flow.

Other `route_cli.py` options:

| Option | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--obstacle-zones=GND,GUC` | zones of these nets / net classes (`*`, `?` allowed) stay fixed copper that other nets must not cross; their fill (not the outline) is the obstacle |
| `--clearance-margin-um=5` | added to every clearance for the router (KiCad measures exact via circles); 0 turns it off |
| `--live` | watch the routing live in the web browser (see the option above) |
| `--export-only --work-dir DIR` | only writes the prepared DSN and the fastroute arguments (`args.txt`) |

Clearances not in KiCad's Specctra export are added as keepouts: the copper-to-edge clearance
around cutouts inside the board outline, the local clearance of pads without a net (fiducials,
mounting pads), and `hole_clearance` rules of the `.kicad_dru` for holes without a net.

`.kicad_dru` rules the plugin cannot carry over are listed as warnings before routing, with the
reason; nets longer than a `length (max …)` rule are listed after routing.

`tests/e2e.sh` routes the KiCad demo boards this way and runs KiCad's DRC on
the result (optionally side by side with Freerouting via `FREEROUTING_CMD`).

## Results

The message after routing shows the router's own numbers and KiCad's: *unrouted connections*
are the ones the router had to route and could not (a pad that KiCad connects through a copper
zone is unrouted to the router, since the plugin routes zone nets with tracks); *open
connections in KiCad* is KiCad's ratsnest count after the import and the zone refill, which is
what you will see on the board. Clearance violations between fixed items of the design (the
plugin adds a small margin to every clearance, so tracks of the original design at exactly the
clearance count) are listed separately as not fixable by routing.

See [docs/IMPROVEMENTS.md](../../docs/IMPROVEMENTS.md) for the full table.
KiCad 10 DRC after re-routing from scratch (unconnected items / routing violations):

| complex_hierarchy | 0 / 1 | 83 / 3 | 0 / 0 (0.7 s) |
| interf_u | 0 / 3 | 8 / 346 | 0 / 2 (5.6 s) |
| pic_programmer | 0 / 8 | 0 / 118 | 0 / 0 (0.7 s) |
| ecc83-pp | 0 / 0 | 0 / 6 | 0 / 0 (0.3 s) |
| sonde xilinx | 0 / 38 | 1 / 122 | 0 / 36 (0.4 s) |

## Known limitations

- Uses the classic `pcbnew` Python action-plugin API (KiCad 7–10). The KiCad 10
  IPC plugin API has no Specctra export yet.
- Differential pairs run side by side where there is room next to the first net's
  path; pad pairs in swapped order, branches and intra-pair length matching are not
  handled (see docs/IMPROVEMENTS.md).
